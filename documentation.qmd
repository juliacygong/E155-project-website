## Testbenches
Before hardware implementation, the top level module of the FFT, `fft_ctrl`, was tested with a testbench which takes a generated ideal bitstream data, and input into the system bit by bit. This simulates the SPI transfer action in real hardward, and as shown in the picture, the FFT was able to produce a a stable note `D5#`, or `db` in with our defined encodings.

Each modules within the FFT, including `fftfull`, `addgen`, etc., are tested by separate testbench too.
